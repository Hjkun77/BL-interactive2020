      On November 23, 2009, <u>34 media workers</u> (30 journalists, numbers may vary due to different definitions of “media worker” and journalist), along with lawyers, relatives of Esmael Magundadatu, and other civilians, were killed on the way to Magundadatu's <u>filing for candidacy</u>. At least 5 of the female victims, 4 of whom were journalists, were raped before being shot. Nearly all <u>female</u> victims were shot in their genitalia. The local police were found to have been involved in the killings, being ordered by senior members of the <u>Ampatuan clan</u> to carry out and cover up the massacre. The perpetrators were unable to finish clean up operations as the area was spotted by a <u>helicopter</u>. All but one of the bodies of the victims were found. The Ampatuan massacre is often remembered as the <u>deadliest attack on the press in history</u>. The massacre was also an instance of election violence.

      A total of <u>197 people</u> were identified as suspects, 90 suspects were arrested, 11 released on bail, and several, including the primary suspect, Andal Ampatuan Sr., died in custody. <u>80 suspects</u> were still at large by the end of 2019. Ten years after the Ampatuan massacre, Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes passed a <u>verdict</u> for the suspects in police custody on December 18, 2019. The court found 33 of the suspects guilty on 57 counts of murder as the 58th was never found. The accused faced the charge of <u>58 counts of murder</u>, one count for each victim. In January 2020, <u>2 more suspects</u> were identified and arrested by the police. Listed below are the journalists killed in the massacre as listed by the <u>Committee to Protect Journalists</u>.
